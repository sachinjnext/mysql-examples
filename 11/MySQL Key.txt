-- Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that each row has a unique identifier and provides a fast lookup mechanism. Typically, a primary key is defined when creating a table.
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);


-- Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables and enforces referential integrity.
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
);


-- Unique Key: A unique key is a column or a set of columns that ensures the values are unique, similar to a primary key. However, a unique key can allow NULL values, whereas a primary key does not. A table can have multiple unique keys.
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE
);


-- Index: An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It can be created on one or more columns and helps optimize query performance by allowing faster searching and sorting.
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    INDEX idx_product_name (product_name)
);
